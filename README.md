## 📘 Overview  

This project explores FIFA player data using Python and data visualization techniques to uncover insights about player attributes, performance, and positions.  
It demonstrates strong skills in **data cleaning, feature aggregation, and visual storytelling** using Seaborn and Matplotlib.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Clean and preprocess FIFA player data for analysis  
- Explore relationships between **age**, **overall rating**, **weight**, and **preferred foot**  
- Visualize attribute distributions and national trends  
- Identify **top four attributes per position** using aggregated statistics  
- Build clear, data-driven insights using visual analytics

## 🧠 Key Insights  

| Category | Observation |
|-----------|--------------|
| ⚡ **Player Skills** | Agility, Acceleration, and Ball Control dominate most field positions |
| 🧤 **Goalkeepers** | Excel in GKReflexes, GKHandling, and GKPositioning |
| 🌍 **Nationalities** | England, Spain, Germany, and Brazil dominate player representation |
| 🦶 **Preferred Foot** | 80% of players are right-footed, but skill ratings are balanced |
| 🏋️ **Physical Attributes** | Weight and balance vary more across regions than positions |
